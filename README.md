How do I approach designing software?
The software design process was structured around creating a realistic and relatable 3D scene. The choice of a desk workspace allowed for deliberate and functional design decisions:

**Inspiration:** The workspace setup was chosen for its familiarity, ensuring users could easily connect with the virtual environment.
**Object Selection:** Elements such as the monitor, keyboard, table, and legs were chosen for their simplicity and ability to demonstrate technical features like textures and lighting.
**Structural Integrity:** Objects were built using foundational 3D shapes (boxes, cylinders, and planes) to maintain a balance between realism and computational efficiency.
**Realism and Engagement:** By adding detailed touches, like marble textures for the table or a realistic monitor stand, the scene felt immersive.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
**Modular Design:** Developing reusable functions (e.g., for texture application and object transformation) to keep the code clean and organized.
**3D Scene Composition:** Designing scenes with attention to object placement, proportion, and visual balance.
**Texture Application:** Learning to select, load, and apply textures to enhance realism (e.g., marble on a table or static textures on the monitor screen).
**Lighting Design:** Creating depth and mood by implementing directional and point lighting, enhancing the scene’s visual impact.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
The design process involved several structured steps:

**Conceptualization:** Selecting the workspace theme as the foundation for the project.
**Prototyping:** Building the initial 3D objects using basic shapes and positioning them in the scene.
**Feature Enhancement:** Gradually adding textures, lighting, and navigation systems to improve realism and interactivity.
**Testing and Iteration:** Regularly testing the scene for visual cohesion and user experience, fine-tuning elements like lighting angles and object scaling.
**Final Refinement:** Ensuring the code was modular, readable, and efficient for future enhancements.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
**Scalable Design:** Modular functions and classes allow for the easy addition of new objects or features in future projects.
**Iterative Development:** Testing and refining visuals and user interactions can improve project outcomes across fields like game design and VR development.
**User-Centric Approach:** Prioritizing intuitive navigation systems can ensure better engagement in interactive applications.
**Cross-Disciplinary Applications:** The focus on combining textures, lighting, and design principles is relevant in various domains, from architectural visualization to scientific simulations.

How do I approach developing programs?
Programming focused on creating modular, reusable code structures. Development began with essential functionalities and expanded iteratively:

**Function-Based Development:** Core functions like CreateGLTexture and SetTransformations were designed for repeated use, ensuring scalability.
**Navigation Systems:** Implemented intuitive keyboard and mouse controls to allow users to seamlessly explore the 3D scene.
**Code Efficiency:** Organized the project with clear boundaries for classes and methods, making debugging and future development easier.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
**Reusable Functions:** Functions were created for tasks like texture loading and object transformations, reducing redundancy and simplifying code management.
**Dynamic Camera Management:** The camera system was designed to respond dynamically to keyboard and mouse inputs, allowing smooth movement and rotation.
**Layered Development:** Key features like lighting, textures, and navigation were developed in stages, ensuring focus and incremental progress.

How did iteration factor into your development?
**Testing and Refining:** Iteration was central to improving object placement, lighting angles, and texture application.
**Feature Enhancement:** Gradual layering of features like dynamic camera movements and multiple lighting types allowed for continuous improvement.
**Performance Tuning:** Iterative adjustments ensured the scene remained visually appealing without compromising performance.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
**From Basic to Advanced:** Initially focusing on basic object creation and gradually integrating textures, lighting, and navigation systems.
**Emphasis on Modularity:** Transitioned from ad-hoc solutions to reusable and scalable functions.
**User Experience Focus:** Grew to prioritize interactivity and seamless user navigation.
